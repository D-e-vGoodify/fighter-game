      <p class="two"> Welcome to My Fighting-game </p>
      <p> I just want to tell you how the buttons of the game work </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Once a button is tapped, the players move in the direction and the don't stop on their own but they need to be stopped by the "stop" button. </li>
      <li> The attack button unleashes the sword to attack the enemy. </li>
      <li> Be very careful not to allow your player get lost outside the screen. </li>
      <li> If the players get lost outside the screen, they can still be brought back in using the buttons<li>
      <li> This game is a two player game and is not a vs computer game but a person can still play it alone for fun</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p> Hope you've understood the controls of the game, if yes,
    Click the button below to continue</p>
